### Client-side and server-side ViaVersion implementation for Fabric

Allows the connection to/from different Minecraft versions on your Minecraft client/server (LAN worlds too)

This mod can be installed on 1.14.4, 1.15.2, 1.16.5, 1.17.1, 1.18.2, 1.19.4, 1.20.1, 1.20.4, 1.20.6, 1.21.1 with Fabric Loader.

The `legacy` branch also supports Legacy Fabric 1.8.9 and 1.12.2 versions.

If you are using the latest Minecraft version and care about the gameplay being more enjoyable/functional, you may want to 
check [ViaFabricPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus) out. See the [differences](#viafabricplus) between ViaFabric and ViaFabricPlus.

Note: ViaVersion is designed for Vanilla Minecraft servers. It probably will not work with modded registry entries or
registry synchronization (fabric-registry-sync mod).

## ViaVersion

### How can I install ViaBackwards/ViaRewind/ViaAprilFools?:

- Just drop them into mods folder. Make sure you are using versions compatible with the ViaVersion version you are
  using.

### What versions can ViaVersion, ViaBackwards, ViaRewind and ViaAprilFools translate?:

- **With [ViaVersion](https://viaversion.com)**:
  Your server can accept newer versions. Your client can connect to older versions.

- **Adding [ViaBackwards](https://viaversion.com/backwards) (and
  optionally [ViaRewind](https://viaversion.com/rewind))**:
  Your server can accept older versions. Your client can connect to newer versions.

- **Adding [ViaAprilFools](https://viaversion.com/aprilfools)**: Your server can accept April Fools versions.

  Note: When using ViaFabric for versions older than 1.17, you need [Java 8 builds](https://ci.viaversion.com/)

- Server-side: See https://viaversion.com/

- Client-side:

|                       | 1.8.x | 1.9.x | 1.10-1.20.x | 1.21.x |
|-----------------------|-------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1.14.4-1.20.6 clients | ✓     | ✓     | ✓           | ⟲      | ⟲   ⟲ | ⟲ | ⟲ | ⟲ | ⟲ |
| 1.21.1 client           | ✓     | ✓     | ✓           | ✓      | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

✓ = [ViaVersion](https://viaversion.com) ⟲ = [ViaBackwards](https://viaversion.com/backwards) ⏪
= [ViaRewind](https://viaversion.com/rewind)

*Note: 1.7.x is not supported in ViaFabric - 1.9.x, 1.10.x, 1.11.x, and 1.13.x may cause problems when visiting such servers in client-side mode.*

### Can ViaVersion, ViaBackwards and ViaRewind support snapshots?:

- Check https://viaversion.com/donate for getting early access to snapshots. You can use the preview ViaVersion builds with ViaFabric by 
  putting them in the mods' folder. During Minecraft updates there will be usual a branch on this repository with the updated ViaFabric.

- [ClientViaVersion](https://github.com/Gerrygames/ClientViaVersion): Discontinued 5zig plugin.
- [multiconnect](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multiconnect): Discontinued Fabric mod for connecting to older
  versions: down to 1.11 (stable) and 1.8 (experimental).

### Server-side:

### Standalone proxy:

- [ViaProxy](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaProxy): Standalone ViaVersion proxy with ViaBackwards, ViaRewind and ViaLegacy,
  allowing you to connect to a wide range of versions (down to classic versions) with your modern client (1.7.2+). Supports online mode.
- [VIAaaS](https://github.com/ViaVersion/VIAaaS): Standalone ViaVersion proxy with ViaBackwards and ViaRewind, allowing
  you to connect without a mod installed on your client. Supports online mode.

  Edition servers.
- [PolyMc](https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc): Fabric mods which translates modded items and blocks, allowing
  vanilla to connect using resource packs.

## Commands

### Commands:

- There're 3 server-side alias ``/viaversion``, ``/vvfabric`` and ``/viaver``, and a client-side command
  ``/viafabricclient`` for Minecraft 1.14+ (OP permission level 3 is required for these commands, received
  by [Entity Status Packet](https://wiki.vg/Entity_statuses#Player))

## Configs

### Configuration:

- ViaVersion configuration is available at ``.minecraft/config/viafabric/viaversion.yml``
- ViaFabric configuration is at ``.minecraft/config/viafabric/viafabric.yml``

### How can I disable client-side ViaFabric?:

- You can disable it in the menu or by setting global protocol version to -1 (this will keep per-server translations
  still enabled)

### How to use protocol detection?:

- For using globally, set the protocol to AUTO or -2. For using in a specific
  server: ``ddns.example.com._v-2.viafabric``
- The protocol detector will try to ping with the client native protocol version, differently than multiconnect which
  uses -1 version, which may detect the native server version.

### How can I set the version for specific servers?:

#### Suffix Style

- Append ``._v(VERSION).viafabric`` after the host, before any port.
  - All dots (``.``) in a given version must be replaced with underscores (``_``).
- Examples:
  - ``minigame.example.com._v1_8.viafabric``
  - ``native.example.com._v-1.viafabric``
  - ``auto.example.com._v-2.viafabric``

#### Prefix Style

- Add ``viafabric.v(VERSION);`` before the address.
- Examples:
  - ``viafabric.v1.8;minigame.example.com``
  - ``viafabric.v-1;native.example.com``
  - ``viafabric.v-2;auto.example.com``

## ViaFabricPlus

### Does it work with ViaFabric:

- No, ViaFabric cannot be used with ViaFabricPlus.
