## Commands

### Commands:

- There're 3 server-side alias ``/viaversion``, ``/vvfabric`` and ``/viaver``, and a client-side command
  ``/viafabricclient`` for Minecraft 1.14+ (OP permission level 3 is required for these commands, received
  by [Entity Status Packet](https://wiki.vg/Entity_statuses#Player))

## Configs

### Configuration:

- ViaVersion configuration is available at ``.minecraft/config/viafabric/viaversion.yml``
- ViaFabric configuration is at ``.minecraft/config/viafabric/viafabric.yml``

### How can I disable client-side ViaFabric?:

- You can disable it in the menu or by setting global protocol version to -1 (this will keep per-server translations
  still enabled)

### How to use protocol detection?:

- For using globally, set the protocol to AUTO or -2. For using in a specific
  server: ``ddns.example.com._v-2.viafabric``
- The protocol detector will try to ping with the client native protocol version, differently than multiconnect which
  uses -1 version, which may detect the native server version.

### How can I set the version for specific servers?:

- Append ._v(VERSION).viafabric.
- Examples: ``minigame.example.com._v1_8.viafabric``, ``native.example.com._v-1.viafabric``
  , ``auto.example.com._v-2.viafabric``

## ViaFabricPlus

### Does it work with ViaFabric:

- No, ViaFabric cannot be used with ViaFabricPlus.

### Differences with ViaFabricPlus:
